<h3>Database Overview</h3>
<!-- Naming Conventions for Attributes and Variables -->
<p>This page details the database guidance for the types and scope of
data that will be archived as part of the tidal wetland soil core data
synthesis, developed by the <a
href="https://serc.si.edu/coastalcarbon">Coastal Carbon Network</a>.
This database structure was developed by members of the community it
hopes to serve, and is designed to make datasets machine-readable and
interoperable. Data curated for publication or prepared for ingestion
into the CCN Data Library will follow the naming conventions outlined
herein.</p>
<p>The following database structure is organized in hierarchical levels.
Each level represents a flat spreadsheet file (i.e. CSV file) where
records in each file are linked by common attributes (i.e. columns) such
as <em>study_id</em>, <em>site_id</em>, <em>core_id</em>, and
<em>method_id</em>. Data is housed in up to six separate
spreadsheets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>materials and methods:</strong> contains information on the
methodology of how soil cores were collected and processed.
(Required)</li>
<li><strong>sites:</strong> contains positional and descriptive
information of the coring sites. (Encouraged if information is not
available at the core-level)</li>
<li><strong>cores:</strong> contains positional and descriptive
information about the individual cores collected. (Required)</li>
<li><strong>depthseries:</strong> contains disaggregated depth-series
information for all cores described in the cores table. (Required)</li>
<li><strong>species:</strong> contains information on the dominant plant
species at the site or coring locations. (Encouraged if applicable)</li>
<li><strong>impacts:</strong> contains information on the anthropogenic
impacts at site or coring locations. (Encouraged if applicable)</li>
</ul>
<p>All variables at each level are accompanied by a definition and, if
applicable, associated units or codes. Units are specified for columns
that we wish to keep uniform across synthesized datasets, and codes are
controlled vocabulary for categorical variables. We also include
accompanying sets of recommended controlled vocabulary for key
categorical variables (also known as factors). Use the arrows within the
tables to expand the definitions for categorical variables.</p>
<p>We welcome contributions of soil core data from any coastal wetlands.
We accept data that is published, soon-to-be published, or unpublished
as long as it is available in disaggregated form. This means that soil
profile information is present down to the level of sampling interval.
Throughout the table <strong>key attributes</strong> are in
<strong>bold</strong>. Please strive to provide data for these
attributes whenever possible. Templates of these spreadsheets can be
requested for data entry (see contact information below) or downloaded
from the <a
href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14N-7l1s151Qmp4AqQOWtIeMtc3efsYZT?usp=sharing">CCRCN
Data Templates</a> folder on Google Drive.</p>

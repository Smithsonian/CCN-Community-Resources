subtitle: Improved measuring, reporting, modeling, and mapping of soil carbon burial rates and carbon stocks in coastal wetlands

## Research Questions

- What is the potential for pairing Bayesian statistical methods with process-based modeling to map carbon stocks and sequestration rates?

- How much variation in carbon stocks and burial rates is attributable to field and lab techniques, and how much to process uncertainty?

## (Anticipated) Project Milestones

1. Paper on modeling and forecasting soil carbon sequestration rates
2. Papers on best practices for field, lab, and data management
3. Open-source R package(s) of marsh equilibrium models
4. Mapped products at the scale of the contiguous United States if applicable
